## Define of scope and goals

**Problem**: Providing an easy and efficient for voters to part-take in an election.

**Goals**: The administrator and organisers of the election should be able to:

1. create, update, delete an election
2. add candidates for each office or position in the election
3. remove and update candidates details
4. add and remove voters
5. taking a vote remotely

---

## Requirements

#### Voter Management

1. **Voter Registration**: Voters must be able to register with a unique username, email, and password.
2. **Voter Eligibility**: Admin must be able to review voters details after registration and approve them.
3. **Voter Authentication**: Voters must be able to log in and log out securely.
4. **Voter Authorization**: Only approveds users can participate in voting.
5. **Profile Management**: Voters should be able to view and edit their profiles.

#### Voting Process

5. **Election Creation**: Admins should be able to create new elections with different positions and categories.
6. **Candidate Management**: Admins should be able to add, edit, or remove candidates for each position.
7. **Voting**: Voters should be able to cast their vote for different positions within a single election.
8. **Single Vote Enforcement**: Ensure that users can only vote once per position in an election.

#### Voting Categories

9. **Position Management**: Admins should be able to define different positions within an election (e.g., President, Vice President).

#### Voting Results

11. **Real-Time Results**: Display real-time voting results for each position.
12. **Result Calculation**: Automatically calculate and display the winners based on the votes received.
13. **Result Privacy**: Restrict access to voting results to authorized users until the end of the voting period.

#### Security

14. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive user data (passwords) and votes.
15. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different functionalities (e.g., admin voter. voter).
16. **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all voting activities for audit purposes.

#### Notifications

17. **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications to users for important events (e.g., registration, voting reminders, end of election).
18. **Voting Confirmation**: Send confirmation notifications after a vote is successfully cast.

#### User Experience

19. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is usable on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
20. **Intuitive UI**: Provide a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and voting.

#### Administrative Features

21. **Dashboard**: Provide admins with a dashboard to manage elections, users, and view statistics.
22. **Reporting**: Generate reports on voter turnout, election results, and other relevant metrics.

#### Error Handling

23. **Error Reporting**: Provide meaningful error messages and log errors for troubleshooting.

## Architecture Designs

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend**: React.js
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
3. **Database**: MongoDB and mongoose
4. **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt
5. **Hosting**: Vercel
6. **Additional Services**: Email notifications, logging

### Component Breakdown

#### Frontend

- **User Interface (UI)**
  - Voting Interface
  - User (voter) Registration and Login
  - Profile Management for voters
  - Admin Dashboard for managing elections and candidates
  - Real-time results display

#### Backend

- **API Layer**

  - Handles HTTP requests and responses
  - Routes for user(voters) management, voting, election management, and result display

- **API Endpoints**

  - login

    - > auth/login

  - register

    - > auth/register

  - admin

    - > admin/

  - election

    - > elections/

  - voters

    - > voters/

  - candidates

    - > candidates/

- **Authentication and Authorization**

  - JWT for secure authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (voter, admin)

- **Business Logic Layer**

  - Handles core logic for:
    - voting,
    - ensuring single vote per position

- **Data Access Layer**
  - Interacts with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations

#### Database

- **MongoDB**
  - Stores user data, election data, candidate information, and votes

## Setup the development environment

- **Development Environment**:
  - Set up version control (Git and Github). [X]
  - Configure development tools (Editor(vs code)). [X]
- **Backend Setup**:
  - Initialize a Node.js project. [X]
  - Set up Express.js for the backend framework. [X]
  - Configure Mongoose for MongoDB interaction. [X]
- **Frontend Setup**:
  - Initialize a React.js project(using vite). [X]
  - Set up state management (Context API). [X]

## Development plan

**Roadmap**: UI design => frontend development => User authentication => CRUD Operation => Integrations => Deployment.

**Milestones**: Set up server => Set up database => Implement API (business logic)=> Design and build front-end => Integrate front-end with back-end.

#### Timeline

- **Week 1**: Initial Planning and Design
- **Week 1-2**: Setup and Configuration
- **Week 2-4**: Backend Development
- **Week 5-7**: Frontend Development
- **Week 8**: Deployment
- **Ongoing**: Maintenance and Monitoring

#### Milestones

- Server setup [X]
- database setup [X]
- Frontend design and development
- Integration of server and frontend

## Development of the app

1. **User Registration and Login**

   - User registers or logs in through the frontend.
   - Credentials are sent to the backend.
   - Backend verifies credentials, generates JWT, and sends it back to the frontend.
   - Frontend stores JWT and uses it for authenticated requests.

2. **Voting Process**

   - User navigates to the voting page.
   - Frontend fetches election and candidate data from the backend.
   - User casts a vote.
   - Vote is sent to the backend, where it is verified and stored in the database.

3. **Admin Management**

   - Admin accesses the dashboard to create or manage elections.
   - Admin actions are sent to the backend, where changes are made to the database.

4. **Result Display**
   - Users can view real-time results.
   - Frontend fetches results data from the backend, which calculates and provides the results.

## Testing

## Deployment

- **Deployment Environment**:
  - Set up cloud-based services for hosting (e.g., AWS, Heroku) [can be change on need]
  - Configure continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Deploy Application**:
  - Deploy the backend and frontend applications to the cloud.
  - Configure domain names and SSL certificates for secure access.
